# Welcome
##Summary
Datafunctions is a library of stored procedures for Google BigQuery, which abstract common data manipulation patterns into simple atomic, composable actions.

They can be used for single step transformations, extended and chained together into more complex sequential transformation pipelines.  

Datafunctions are written in Dynamic SQL and executed entirely within BigQuery.

##Status
Datafunctions are currently in active development, with core functions being extended and tested, and additional profiling, monitoring and QA functionality being developed and built into the library. 

The library is currently in private beta.  To request access, please click the button below and fill out a very quick form:
